# ********************* S_Discuss *************************

The project made is a full stack website. It is scalable and future-proof. The site contains a registration  and login page with forget password functionality. The main purpose of the website is to post questions based on different programming languages (C/C++, Java, Django, PHP, Python). The user who knows the answer to posted questions can answer the questions. The tools I have used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, JQuery, API, MySQL, Bootstrap, PHPMailer.<br>
